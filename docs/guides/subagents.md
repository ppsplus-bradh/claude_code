# Subagents

> **Official Documentation:** This guide is based on the [official Claude Agent SDK documentation](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/subagents). Examples are adapted for Elixir.

Define and invoke subagents to isolate context, run tasks in parallel, and apply specialized instructions in your Claude Agent SDK applications.

Subagents are separate agent instances that your main agent can spawn to handle focused subtasks.
Use subagents to isolate context for focused subtasks, run multiple analyses in parallel, and apply specialized instructions without bloating the main agent's prompt.

This guide explains how to define and use subagents in the SDK using the `agents` option.

## Overview

You can create subagents in three ways:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Programmatic** | Use `ClaudeCode.Agent` structs with the `agents` option in `start_link/1` or `stream/3` (recommended for SDK applications) |
| **Filesystem-based** | Define agents as markdown files in `.claude/agents/` directories (see [defining subagents as files](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents)) |
| **Built-in general-purpose** | Claude can invoke the built-in `general-purpose` subagent at any time via the Agent tool without you defining anything |

This guide focuses on the programmatic approach, which is recommended for SDK applications.

When you define subagents, Claude determines whether to invoke them based on each subagent's `description` field. Write clear descriptions that explain when the subagent should be used, and Claude will automatically delegate appropriate tasks. You can also explicitly request a subagent by name in your prompt (for example, "Use the code-reviewer agent to...").

## Benefits of using subagents

### Context isolation

Each subagent runs in its own fresh conversation. Intermediate tool calls and results stay inside the subagent; only its final message returns to the parent. See [What subagents inherit](#what-subagents-inherit) for exactly what's in the subagent's context.

**Example:** a `research-assistant` subagent can explore dozens of files without any of that content accumulating in the main conversation. The parent receives a concise summary, not every file the subagent read.

### Parallelization

Multiple subagents can run concurrently, dramatically speeding up complex workflows.

**Example**: during a code review, you can run `style-checker`, `security-scanner`, and `test-coverage` subagents simultaneously, reducing review time from minutes to seconds.

### Specialized instructions and knowledge

Each subagent can have tailored system prompts with specific expertise, best practices, and constraints.

**Example**: a `database-migration` subagent can have detailed knowledge about SQL best practices, rollback strategies, and data integrity checks that would be unnecessary noise in the main agent's instructions.

### Tool restrictions

Subagents can be limited to specific tools, reducing the risk of unintended actions.

**Example**: a `doc-reviewer` subagent might only have access to Read and Grep tools, ensuring it can analyze but never accidentally modify your documentation files.

## How agents are delivered

Agent configurations are sent to the CLI via the **control protocol initialize handshake**, not as CLI flags. When a session starts, the adapter sends an `initialize` control request that includes the agents map. This matches the behavior of the Python/TypeScript Agent SDKs.

## What subagents inherit

A subagent's context window starts fresh (no parent conversation) but isn't empty. The only channel from parent to subagent is the Agent tool's prompt string, so include any file paths, error messages, or decisions the subagent needs directly in that prompt.

| The subagent receives | The subagent does not receive |
|:---|:---|
| Its own system prompt (`ClaudeCode.Agent` `:prompt`) and the Agent tool's prompt | The parent's conversation history or tool results |
| Project CLAUDE.md (loaded via `setting_sources`) | The parent's system prompt |
| Tool definitions (inherited from parent, or the subset in `:tools`) | |

> The parent receives the subagent's final message verbatim as the Agent tool result, but may summarize it in its own response. To preserve subagent output verbatim in the user-facing response, include an instruction to do so in the prompt or `:system_prompt` option you pass to the **main** session.

## Creating subagents

### Programmatic definition (recommended)

Define subagents directly in your code using `ClaudeCode.Agent` structs and the `agents` option. This example creates two subagents: a code reviewer with read-only access and a test runner that can execute commands. The `Agent` tool must be included in `allowed_tools` since Claude invokes subagents through the Agent tool.

```elixir
alias ClaudeCode.Agent

{:ok, session} = ClaudeCode.start_link(
  agents: [
    Agent.new(
      name: "code-reviewer",
      # description tells Claude when to use this subagent
      description: "Expert code review specialist. Use for quality, security, and maintainability reviews.",
      # prompt defines the subagent's behavior and expertise
      prompt: """
      You are a code review specialist with expertise in security, performance, and Elixir best practices.

      When reviewing code:
      - Identify security vulnerabilities
      - Check for performance issues
      - Verify adherence to coding standards
      - Suggest specific improvements

      Be thorough but concise in your feedback.
      """,
      # tools restricts what the subagent can do (read-only here)
      tools: ["Read", "Grep", "Glob"],
      # model overrides the default model for this subagent
      model: "sonnet"
    ),
    Agent.new(
      name: "test-runner",
      description: "Runs and analyzes test suites. Use for test execution and coverage analysis.",
      prompt: """
      You are a test execution specialist. Run tests and provide clear analysis of results.

      Focus on:
      - Running test commands
      - Analyzing test output
      - Identifying failing tests
      - Suggesting fixes for failures
      """,
      # Bash access lets this subagent run test commands
      tools: ["Bash", "Read", "Grep"]
    )
  ],
  # Agent tool is required for subagent invocation
  allowed_tools: ["Read", "Grep", "Glob", "Agent"]
)
```

### Agent fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|:------|:-----|:---------|:------------|
| `name` | string | Yes | Unique agent identifier (used as the map key when sent to the CLI) |
| `description` | string | Yes | Natural language description of when to use this agent. Claude uses this to decide when to delegate. |
| `prompt` | string | Yes | System prompt defining the agent's role and behavior |
| `tools` | list | No | Tools the agent can use. If omitted, inherits all tools. |
| `model` | string | No | Model override: `"sonnet"`, `"opus"`, `"haiku"`, or `"inherit"`. Defaults to session model. |

> The Elixir SDK allows `nil` for `description` and `prompt`, but the official SDK treats them as required. Always provide both for reliable subagent behavior.

> Subagents cannot spawn their own subagents. Don't include `"Agent"` in a subagent's `tools` list.

### Filesystem-based definition (alternative)

You can also define subagents as markdown files in `.claude/agents/` directories. See the [Claude Code subagents documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents) for details on this approach. Programmatically defined agents take precedence over filesystem-based agents with the same name.

> Even without defining custom subagents, Claude can spawn the built-in `general-purpose` subagent when `"Agent"` is in your `allowed_tools`. This is useful for delegating research or exploration tasks without creating specialized agents.

## Invoking subagents

### Automatic invocation

Claude automatically decides when to invoke subagents based on the task and each subagent's `description`. For example, if you define a `performance-optimizer` subagent with the description "Performance optimization specialist for query tuning", Claude will invoke it when your prompt mentions optimizing queries.

Write clear, specific descriptions so Claude can match tasks to the right subagent.

```elixir
# Claude will automatically delegate to the code-reviewer agent
session
|> ClaudeCode.stream("Review the authentication module for security issues")
|> ClaudeCode.Stream.text_content()
|> Enum.each(&IO.write/1)
```

### Explicit invocation

To guarantee Claude uses a specific subagent, mention it by name in your prompt. This bypasses automatic matching and directly invokes the named subagent.

```elixir
session
|> ClaudeCode.stream("Use the code-reviewer agent to check the authentication module")
|> ClaudeCode.Stream.text_content()
|> Enum.each(&IO.write/1)
```

### Dynamic agent configuration

Create agent definitions dynamically based on runtime conditions. This example creates a security reviewer with different strictness levels, using a more capable model for strict reviews:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Agents do
  alias ClaudeCode.Agent

  # Factory function that returns an Agent struct
  # This pattern lets you customize agents based on runtime conditions
  def security_reviewer(level) do
    strict? = level == :strict

    Agent.new(
      name: "security-reviewer",
      description: "Security code reviewer",
      # Customize the prompt based on strictness level
      prompt: if(strict?,
        do: "You are a strict security reviewer. Flag all potential issues, even minor ones.",
        else: "You are a balanced security reviewer. Focus on critical and high-severity issues."
      ),
      tools: ["Read", "Grep", "Glob"],
      # Key insight: use a more capable model for high-stakes reviews
      model: if(strict?, do: "opus", else: "sonnet")
    )
  end
end

# The agent is created at session time, so each session can use different settings
{:ok, session} = ClaudeCode.start_link(
  agents: [MyApp.Agents.security_reviewer(:strict)],
  allowed_tools: ["Read", "Grep", "Glob", "Agent"]
)
```

## Detecting subagent invocation

Subagents are invoked via the Agent tool. To detect when a subagent is invoked, check for `tool_use` blocks where `name` is `"Agent"`. Messages from within a subagent's context include a `parent_tool_use_id` field.

> The tool name was renamed from `"Task"` to `"Agent"` in Claude Code v2.1.63. Current SDK releases emit `"Agent"` in `tool_use` blocks but still use `"Task"` in the `system:init` tools list and in `result.permission_denials[].tool_name`. Checking both values ensures compatibility across SDK versions.

This example iterates through streamed messages, logging when a subagent is invoked and when subsequent messages originate from within that subagent's execution context:

```elixir
session
|> ClaudeCode.stream("Review the code and write tests for lib/my_app.ex")
|> Stream.each(fn
  %ClaudeCode.Message.AssistantMessage{message: %{content: blocks}} ->
    Enum.each(blocks, fn
      # Match both names for backward compatibility
      %ClaudeCode.Content.ToolUseBlock{name: name, input: input}
      when name in ["Task", "Agent"] ->
        IO.puts("Subagent invoked: #{input["subagent_type"]}")
      _ -> :ok
    end)

  %{parent_tool_use_id: id} when not is_nil(id) ->
    IO.puts("  (running inside subagent)")

  _ -> :ok
end)
|> Stream.run()
```

## Resuming subagents

Subagents can be resumed to continue where they left off. Resumed subagents retain their full conversation history, including all previous tool calls, results, and reasoning. The subagent picks up exactly where it stopped rather than starting fresh.

When a subagent completes, Claude receives its agent ID in the Agent tool result. To resume a subagent programmatically:

1. **Capture the session ID**: Extract `session_id` from messages during the first query
2. **Extract the agent ID**: Parse `agentId` from the message content
3. **Resume the session**: Pass `resume: session_id` in the second query's options, and include the agent ID in your prompt

> You must resume the same session to access the subagent's transcript. Each `ClaudeCode.query/2` call starts a new session by default, so pass `resume: session_id` to continue in the same session.
>
> If you're using a custom agent (not a built-in one), you also need to pass the same agent definition in the `agents` option for both queries.

The example below demonstrates this flow: the first query runs a subagent and captures the session ID and agent ID, then the second query resumes the session to ask a follow-up question that requires context from the first analysis.

```elixir
alias ClaudeCode.Message.{AssistantMessage, SystemMessage}

# First invocation - use the Explore agent to find API endpoints
{agent_id, session_id} =
  ClaudeCode.query("Use the Explore agent to find all API endpoints in this codebase",
    allowed_tools: ["Read", "Grep", "Glob", "Agent"]
  )
  |> Enum.reduce({nil, nil}, fn
    %SystemMessage{session_id: sid}, {aid, _sid} ->
      {aid, sid}

    %AssistantMessage{message: %{content: blocks}}, {aid, sid} ->
      # Search content blocks for the agentId (appears in Agent tool results)
      new_aid =
        blocks
        |> Enum.find_value(fn block ->
          text = inspect(block)
          case Regex.run(~r/agentId:\s*([a-f0-9-]+)/, text) do
            [_, id] -> id
            _ -> nil
          end
        end)

      {new_aid || aid, sid}

    _other, acc ->
      acc
  end)

# Second invocation - resume and ask follow-up
if agent_id && session_id do
  ClaudeCode.query(
    "Resume agent #{agent_id} and list the top 3 most complex endpoints",
    allowed_tools: ["Read", "Grep", "Glob", "Agent"],
    resume: session_id
  )
  |> ClaudeCode.Stream.final_result()
end
```

Subagent transcripts persist independently of the main conversation:

- **Main conversation compaction**: When the main conversation compacts, subagent transcripts are unaffected. They're stored in separate files.
- **Session persistence**: Subagent transcripts persist within their session. You can resume a subagent after restarting Claude Code by resuming the same session.
- **Automatic cleanup**: Transcripts are cleaned up based on the `cleanupPeriodDays` setting (default: 30 days).

## Per-query agent overrides

Override agent definitions for specific queries:

```elixir
session
|> ClaudeCode.stream("Review this module",
     agents: [
       Agent.new(
         name: "code-reviewer",
         description: "Security-focused code reviewer",
         prompt: "Focus exclusively on security vulnerabilities and OWASP issues.",
         tools: ["Read", "Grep"]
       )
     ])
|> ClaudeCode.Stream.text_content()
|> Enum.each(&IO.write/1)
```

## Using the `agent` option

Select a specific agent for the entire session:

```elixir
{:ok, session} = ClaudeCode.start_link(
  agents: [
    Agent.new(
      name: "reviewer",
      description: "Code reviewer",
      prompt: "You review code for quality."
    )
  ],
  agent: "reviewer"
)
```

## Tool restrictions

Subagents can have restricted tool access via the `tools` field:

- **Omit the field**: agent inherits all available tools (default)
- **Specify tools**: agent can only use listed tools

This example creates a read-only analysis agent that can examine code but cannot modify files or run commands:

```elixir
{:ok, session} = ClaudeCode.start_link(
  agents: [
    Agent.new(
      name: "code-analyzer",
      description: "Static code analysis and architecture review",
      prompt: """
      You are a code architecture analyst. Analyze code structure,
      identify patterns, and suggest improvements without making changes.
      """,
      # Read-only tools: no Edit, Write, or Bash access
      tools: ["Read", "Grep", "Glob"]
    )
  ],
  allowed_tools: ["Read", "Grep", "Glob", "Agent"]
)
```

### Common tool combinations

| Use case | Tools | Description |
|:---------|:------|:------------|
| Read-only analysis | `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob` | Can examine code but not modify or execute |
| Test execution | `Bash`, `Read`, `Grep` | Can run commands and analyze output |
| Code modification | `Read`, `Edit`, `Write`, `Grep`, `Glob` | Full read/write access without command execution |
| Full access | All tools | Inherits all tools from parent (omit `tools` field) |

## Troubleshooting

### Claude not delegating to subagents

If Claude completes tasks directly instead of delegating to your subagent:

1. **Include the Agent tool**: subagents are invoked via the Agent tool, so it must be in `allowed_tools`
2. **Use explicit prompting**: mention the subagent by name in your prompt (for example, "Use the code-reviewer agent to...")
3. **Write a clear description**: explain exactly when the subagent should be used so Claude can match tasks appropriately

### Subagents not spawning their own subagents

This is by design. Don't include `"Agent"` in a subagent's `tools` list.

### Filesystem-based agents not loading

Agents defined in `.claude/agents/` are loaded at startup only. If you create a new agent file while Claude Code is running, restart the session to load it.

### Windows: long prompt failures

On Windows, subagents with very long prompts may fail due to command line length limits (8191 chars). Keep prompts concise or use filesystem-based agents for complex instructions.
